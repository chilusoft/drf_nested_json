# Nested Json Data in Django Rest Framework

- This is a project that will help you work with nested serialized data in drf.

Working With nested json data in the django rest framework can be a real pain.
I came across this after building a full API but faced trouble when working with
The Http Methods such as the `POST` and `PUT` methods. The framework complained
about carelessly updated data without setting the linked models correctly, 

You can use the underlying code to build your API and pick everything from there
